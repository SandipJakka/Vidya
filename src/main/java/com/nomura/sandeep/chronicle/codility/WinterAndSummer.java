/**
 * John was sitting near to a fireplace in his house, trying to get
 * some warmth from the fire. Fighting his cold at the end of a freezing, short,
 * dark winter day, he started wondering why it always had to be so cold during this season.
 * That was when he came up with an idea.
 * <p>
 * John stated that winter is the initial part of the year in which it is always colder than
 * in the remaining part. This latter part is called 'summer'. Then he assumed that summer is
 * always warmer than winter; that is, any temperature measured in winter is colder than every
 * temperature measured in summer.
 * <p>
 * Then he searched the Internet and found the previous year's meteorological data, which contained
 * the year's temperature measurements. He began to wonder if it might be possible to divide the year
 * into winter and summer so that winter comes before summer and each winter's temperature measurement
 * is smaller than any temperature measured in summer. In case there are many such possible partitions,
 * find the one in which the winter period is as short as possible. (It is quite cold now; there is really no reason for winter to be longer than necessary...)
 * <p>
 * Write a function:
 * <p>
 * class Solution { public int solution(int[] T); }
 * <p>
 * that, given a sequence T of temperature measurements (specified as integer numbers),
 * finds the partition of the year into winter and summer that meets the conditions above and makes
 * winter as short as possible, then returns the length of the winter. Both winter and summer have to be at
 * least one day long. You can assume that there exists at least one partition that satisfies this condition.
 * <p>
 * For example, given:
 * <p>
 * T = [5, -2, 3, 8, 6]
 * the function should return 3, as after partitioning the year into winter: [5, -2, 3] and summer: [8, 6],
 * each winter's measurement is smaller than each summer's temperature.
 * <p>
 * On the other hand, for the following array:
 * <p>
 * T = [-5, -5, -5, -42, 6, 12]
 * the function should return 4. The partition that minimizes the length of the winter is [-5, -5, -5, -42]
 * and [6, 12]. Winter could also have length 5, but the function should return the shortest possible winter.
 * <p>
 * Assume that:
 * <p>
 * N is an integer within the range [2..300,000];
 * each element of array T is an integer within the range [âˆ’1,000,000,000..1,000,000,000];
 * There will be at least one correct way to divide the year into winter and summer.
 * Complexity:
 * <p>
 * expected worst-case time complexity is O(N);
 * expected worst-case space complexity is O(N), beyond input storage (not counting the storage required for
 * input arguments).
